# WindfallData

I'm the lead data scientist at Windfall Data, where I'm working with a number of data sources to identify affluent households in the US. The project contains code samples from my blog posts related to projects at Windfall Data:

* [Clustering the Top 1%: Asset Analysis in R](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/clustering-the-top-1-asset-analysis-in-r-6c529b382b42)
